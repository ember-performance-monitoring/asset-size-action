# what is this?

A GitHub action for automating build asset size analysis.
The goal is to consolidate efforts from @mansona's work in [ember-asset-size-action](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-asset-size-action)
and [ember.js/data's](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/master/bin/asset-size-tracking) internal implementation.
